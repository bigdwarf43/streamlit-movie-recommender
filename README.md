# streamlit-movie-recommender


The movie recommendation system suggests five related movies to any movie that you input into the system. You can also view the descriptions of your favorite movies. If you input spiderman into the system it will recommend 5 movies related to spiderman like spiderman 2, spiderman 3, etc.

The project is built with Streamlit as the frontend development tool and MongoDB as the backend database. We have used the TMDB API for movie descriptions and images. This project uses collaborative filtering and is based on content-based recommendation system.
